## 1. Core Principles

- **Small tasks, one at a time**: Always work in baby steps, one at a time. Never go forward more than one step.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Start with failing tests for any new functionality (TDD), according to the task details.
- **Type Safety**: All code must be fully typed.
- **Clear Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for all variables and functions.
- **Incremental Changes**: Prefer incremental, focused changes over large, complex modifications.
- **Question Assumptions**: Always question assumptions and inferences.
- **Pattern Detection**: Detect and highlight repeated code patterns.

## 2. Language Standards
- **English Only**: All technical artifacts must always use English, including:
    - Code (variables, functions, classes, comments, error messages, log messages)
    - Documentation (README, guides, API docs)
    - Jira tickets (titles, descriptions, comments)
    - Data schemas and database names
    - Configuration files and scripts
    - Git commit messages
    - Test names and descriptions

## 3. Specific standards

For detailed standards and guidelines specific to different areas of the project, refer to:

- [Backend Standards](./backend-standards.mdc) - API development, database patterns, testing, security and backend best practices
- [Frontend Standards](./frontend-standards.mdc) - React components, UI/UX guidelines, and frontend architecture
- [Documentation Standards](./documentation-standards.mdc) - Technical documentation structure, formatting, and maintenance guidelines, including AI standards like this document

<!-- ## Workflow
- Start complex tasks in Plan mode
- Get plan approval before implementation
- Break large changes into reviewable chunks

## Verification Requirements
- Run `npm test` after code changes
- Run `npm run typecheck` before marking complete
- For API changes, test with `curl` or Postman
- For UI changes, verify in browser before committing -->
